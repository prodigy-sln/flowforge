## Completed Deliverables

### Architecture Documents (in `docs/` folder):
1. **01-architecture-overview.md** - High-level system architecture and principles
2. **02-system-components.md** - Detailed component specifications
3. **03-data-flow.md** - Data flow patterns and integrations
4. **04-technology-stack.md** - Technology choices and rationale
5. **05-deployment-architecture.md** - Deployment strategies and configurations

### Peer Review Document:
- **architecture-peer-review.md** - Comprehensive architectural review with:
  - Executive summary
  - Strengths analysis
  - Critical issues and concerns
  - Detailed recommendations
  - Risk assessment
  - Implementation priorities
  - Overall architecture score: 7.5/10

## Next Steps (Not Yet Started)

Based on the peer review, the following should be addressed before implementation:

1. Address Docker-in-Docker security concerns
2. Detail the conflict resolution validation process
3. Create intermediate deployment options between MVP and full production
4. Add comprehensive testing strategy documentation
5. Design cost tracking and management system
6. Create proof-of-concept for Git conflict resolution mechanism
